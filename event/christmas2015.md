NOTE: There is currently a drop rate boost for Presents until the end of the event. The current rates listed are the boosted ones.

Ephinea's Christmas Event has started and is currently underway! The event will finish at maintenance on the 2nd of January (2/1/2016).

For the duration of the event, the "Christmas Fiasco" quest will be up in all 3 Episodes! The quest will be under the Event section in each episode. How fast can you clear this holiday from hell (if at all)?

In addition to this, Christmas Presents will drop from all enemies, regardless of quest, difficulty or episode. These presents will contain coveted and special items, some of them only obtainable through them, so get hunting. The drop rate of the presents is as follows in PSO2 mode (Classic will use 1P rate):

1P: 1/1500
2P: 1/1770
3P: 1/2088
4P: 1/2463

This drop rate isn't affected by DAR or rare boosts. Furthermore, the presents can only be obtained from monsters, boxes are exempt.

The items in the present will vary by difficulty, but all difficulties will be able to obtain items from difficulties below. It is up to the community to figure out the items in the presents.
