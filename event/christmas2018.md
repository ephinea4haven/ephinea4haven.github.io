Rambling May, Guardianna, Holy Ray, and Asteron Belt were temporarily made more common in exchange for having variable hit instead of a static 50 Hit, and Daylight Scar was made 30 Hit while retaining its rarity.

About eight hours later, Rambling May, Guardianna, Holy Ray, and Asteron Belt have all been reverted to being 50 hit guaranteed in exchange for being slightly rarer than they previously were. Daylight Scar remains at 30 hit, but is now more common than it previously was.

This is how the Present list should remain for the rest of the event, but it still mostly lies outside of my control. I offer my deepest apologies to anybody who opened Presents in the timeframe that the old nerf was in effect.

Hey all. Matt isn't around to make a proper thread yet, so here's a filler thread! Matt can either kill it and make a proper one later or he can just hijack this one. YOUR CHOICE MATT

Welcome to Christmas 2018! This time, I personally ruined it. Many of the mechanics are similar to 2017, so if you want to brush up on that, check out our thread from last year: https://www.pioneer2.net/community/threads/ephinea-christmas-2017.9136/

There are some changes this year, though:

- The item list is a bit (lot) larger now, in an attempt to avoid printing too many powerful items and totally tank the economy. There's a mixture of old and new items to find, so.. go find things! Yeah!!!!! HELP I DIDN'T PLAN THIS OP OUT
- Stackable items, such as Photon Drops, can drop in larger stacks than just one at a time, so if you get lucky on a roll you could get multiple Photon Drops at a time. Because of this, Coal from presents is far more valuable, so you don't have to exclusively play Fiasco if you don't want to!
- Many presents now come with a variable chance of hit instead of being a static amount of hit, so you could hit it big and get something with upwards of 60 hit!

Anyway, here's a partial list of presents that will be filled out as needed. As you find items, the list will be filled out so everyone knows what's available!
If something drops in multiple difficulties, it will be filled out for all difficulties it drops in.
Items with variable hit will be denoted as such, items with static hit will have their specific hit listed.
Stackable items will be shown ahead of time in order to prevent tragedy. I have NO IDEA what metric was used to show other things so its going to be really barren at first!!!!


Remember that presents do not drop from Rappies that are scared away, nor do they drop from boxes. Rappies that are defeated normally will still drop presents, though.
