Ephinea's Christmas Event for 2016 has begun! This event will last from now (6/12/2016) to 9th Jan (9/1/2017).

For the duration of this event, the quests "Christmas Fiasco" and Christmas Present drops will be making a return, similar to the event of last year, although the Presents now contain different items, some of them unique to this event.

The Christmas Presents will be dropping from all enemies, regardless of episode, quest or difficulty (free-roam is also able to drop Presents). The Presents will contain many desired items, but it's up to the community to discover what these items are by hunting for them and posting their findings here.

Note that presents will not drop from boxes.

The drop rate for the presents are as follows:

1P: 1/1500
2P: 1/1770
3P: 1/2088
4P: 1/2463

Please note that the rates are not affected by HBR or Luck boosts.

Unlike last year, some items will be unique to their difficulty, meaning you won't be obtaining some of the junk Normal ~ Very Hard items in Ultimate anymore, although some items will be obtainable in the base difficulty and above.

Items in red will be obtainable from the difficulty it drops in and all above (i.e. if it drops in Hard, it will also drop in Very Hard and Ultimate).
