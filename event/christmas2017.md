Coal

Coal is a Christmas-exclusive currency obtainable from clearing Christmas Fiasco and also obtainable as a common item from presents. Using Coal, you'll be able to trade for items in the new Christmas Event Shop, located in Episode 1's Shop category.

The Coal rates from Fiasco are as follows (N / H / VH / U):

Episode 1: 1 / 1 / 2 / 4
Episode 2: 1 / 2 / 3 / 6
Episode 4: 1 / 1 / 2 / 4

What's in the Christmas Event Shop?

In the Christmas Event Shop, you'll find 2 returning NPCs near the bank that you can trade your Coal to. Why do they want Coal? Who knows, maybe you should ask them.

What's in the Christmas Presents!?

That would be telling.

The items in the Christmas Presents are up to the community to find. Compared to the previous 2 years, the items are different, so there may be new surprises, or even returning items. If you find any items, feel free to post them here!

All Christmas Presents will drop at 1/1,500 rate, regardless of episode, difficulty or drop modifiers. The presents dropped will also give items depending on the difficulty, and the items in the presents are not shared across difficulties.

Note that presents will not drop from scared rappies or boxes, you need to defeat enemies!

Coal will drop in all difficulties as a common item.
You can also get Halloween Cookies in all difficulties as a common item.
