It's gone through several changes since being introduced and has been asked about a few times, so I figured I'd make bullet point list on what Ephinea's Anguish mode is. So, yeah, here goes!

What is Anguish?

 It is NOT a replacement for the Ultimate difficulty nor is it a progression from the Ultimate difficulty.
Anguish is simply provided as a way to challenge yourself but also have some fun hunting common weapons.

 As you the increase in Anguish level setting, the monsters also become stronger in the following ways:

* Hitpoints increase  
* Experience gained increases  
* Rare item drop chance increases  
* Meseta dropped increases  
* Damage increases (Fixed damage increases by 40% of the displayed value)  
* Attack power (ATP) increases  
* Accuracy (ATA) increases  
* Defense (DFP) increases  
* Evasion (EVP) increases  
* Critical hit chance (LCK) increaes  
* Resistance to Megid and Hell (EDK) increases  
* Resistance to impairing effects (ESP) increases  
* Movement speed increases  
* Some monsters cast higher level techniques.  

Anguish level can be set at the lobby counter just before creating a game on Ultimate mode.

For each Anguish level, you can see specifics for monster increases at the lobby counter by pressing TAB.

- The monsters in the earlier areas of each Episode become almost as strong as the later areas.

- The drop anything rate increases by 1% for each Anguish level:
Anguish Lv. 1 -> + 1%  
Anguish Lv. 2 -> + 2%  
Anguish Lv. 3 -> + 3%  
Anguish Lv. 4 -> + 4%  
Anguish Lv. 5 -> + 5%

Anguish Lv. 8 -> + 8%  
Anguish Lv. 9 -> + 9%  
Anguish Lv. 10 -> + 10%

increases by 2% for each Anguish level:

**All chance increases only affect monsters and NOT boxes.**

When I mention "Area chance" up there, it simply means the normal chance for Ultimate mode 
based on the current party leader's section ID and the current floor of the area 
you're at. (E.g. Bluefull Ruins 2's chance in Ultimate mode would be an area chance.)

... I think that covers just about everything. If I missed something or 
if something changes in the future, I'll be sure to go back and 
edit this post.
